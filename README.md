### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning fullstack development
- ðŸŒ± As of September 2022, Iâ€™m currently learning HTML and CSS, as we've completed our Git unit.
- âœ¨ I'm most intrested in learning HTML & CSS out of all the unit's available as I've had some basic experience with both, I'm more comfortable with the things I'm most familiar with. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the set up with Visual Studio Code as I have some issues in terms of putting theory into practice. Although, I have no issue using CodePen 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my Slack profile
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a self taught video editor and amatuer photographer. These, as well as fitness are my favourite hobbies!
